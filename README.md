Code is provided to reproduce all figure panels of the paper. Some of the simulations can be quickly run on a laptop in Python, like simple timeseries or stability diagrams of the endemic states. Other simulations were run using Python on a cluster, or using C on a laptop over night. The resulting data files are provided for figure reproduction. The Python scripts to run on the cluster are also provided under scripts/cluster/
